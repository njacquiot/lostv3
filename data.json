Alder is an unyielding wood, yet I have discovered that its ideal owner is not stubborn or obstinate, but often helpful, considerate and most likeable. Unicorn hair generally produces the most consistent magic, and is least subject to fluctuations and blockages. Wands with unicorn cores are generally the most difficult to turn to the Dark Arts ",
        "</br>This is a wand made of Alder wood with dragon heartstrings. A sensitive wand, hazel often reflects its ownerâ€™s emotional state and works best for a master who understands and can manage their own feelings. As a rule, dragon heartstrings produce wands with the most power, and which are capable of the most flamboyant spells"

Good luck"
